## Data Science Career

As a Lead Data Scientist at [Choreograph](https://www.choreograph.com/), [WPP](https://www.wpp.com/), I bring over a decade of expertise in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.
My current focus is on leveraging *Agent Based Models (ABM)* to unravel the complexities of consumer behaviour.
I am also passionate about *Generative AI innovations and solutions*, particularly in the development of agentic solutions that are reshaping how we interact with our own data sources. I have driven several MVPs and POCs and community engagements.
Additionally, I have been involved in *geospatial data science*, where I explored the intricate patterns of geographical data to derive meaningful insights. My work in this area can be presented at the [Spatial Data Science Conference 2023](https://youtu.be/zKL6cuiOtcY?si=D-MClSFb4x4LEhqE).

With a rich background in both line and team management, I excel in stakeholder management, crafting data strategies and solutions, and nurturing teams towards achieving strategic goals. My consultancy expertise in data science projects has been instrumental in shaping innovative solutions across various domains.

I am a member and external collaborator at the [Sports Analytics Group]((https://aueb-analytics.wixsite.com/sports)), Department of Statistics at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), where I contribute with my work on basketball analytics. I am the author of the popular [Euroleague API](https://pypi.org/project/euroleague-api/) Python package.

I am also deeply committed to mentoring the next generation of data scientists, actively participating on the [MentorCruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/georgiosgiasemidis/) platform, where I maintain a 5-start rating and score in the top 8% of the mentors. This role allows me to share my knowledge and experience, guiding young professionals in their career journey. Follow the link below to browse available plans and book a session.

Previously, I have participated on [KaggleX](https://www.kagglex.org/) mentoriship programme and the [Mentorloop](https://mentorloop.com/) platform in my organisation.

I enjoy giving webinars and sharing the knowledge on the topics of my expertise, see for example:

- [Advanced Analytics in Euroleague Basketball with Python]("https://www.youtube.com/live/_JLXAQMzA6s?si=ORM8jlZE6GcplYFk")
- [The Power of Scenario Planning for Businesses & Government]("https://www.linkedin.com/events/thepowerofscenarioplanningforbu7259181829709000705/comments/")

My academic contributions include several high-impact publications in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, focusing on time-series forecasting, machine learning applications, network analysis, and theoretical physics. My work has garnered hundreds of citations, a testament to its influence in the scientific community, check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=vVyWiE8AAAAJ&hl=en/) profile.

Before joining Choreograph, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [CountingLab](https://www.countinglabs.co.uk/), a company born from the [Centre for Mathematics of Human Behaviour](https://www.reading.ac.uk/cmohb/) at the University of Reading. This role allowed me to apply my model-building expertise in a dynamic industry setting.

## The Physics Years

Before becoming a data scientist, I have devoted my life in physics and particularly theoretical physics. I obtained my D.Phil. (PhD) in theoretical physics from University of Oxford, Kellogg College, in 2013, studying aspects of [dimensional reduction in graph models of causal quantum gravity](https://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/permalink/44OXF_INST/ao2p7t/cdi_proquest_journals_1683609513).

In 2009, I graduated with excellence from the Physics department of University of Athens, while also spending a semester at the University of Bonn, Germany, via the Erasmus programme.

## Interests

I have a passion for physics, sciences, data science, technology, Lego ([afol](https://g.co/kgs/N2ZiDp)), scuba diving (BSAC dive leader), basketball and analytics.

Panathinaikos and Liverpool fan.
