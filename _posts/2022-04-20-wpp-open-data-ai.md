I was invited to give a presentation at the WPP Open Data & AI session about a recent project I worked for ([WPP](https://www.wpp.com/) is the parent company of [Choreograph](https://www.choreograph.com/), the company I work for).

I welcomed the opportunity and talked about the team I work with, the Strategy Simulations, which is specialised in Agent Based Modelling (ABM). After a brief introduction to ABMs, I talked about a particular model we developed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on categories, such as automotive and travel, across different markets.

Unfortunately I can't share more about the details of the model because it is proprietary of Choreograph. WPP staff can access the recording at the [WPP Open portal](https://open.wpp.com/communities-cat/everyday-lessons-strategy-simulations-covid-impact-modelling-for-travel-and-automotive/).

A nice output from the presentation is this cool art-work created by [Scriberia](https://www.scriberia.com/) summarising the key concepts of the talk.

Hope you enjoy it.
