I am a senior data scientist at [Choreograph](https://www.choreograph.com/) (former [Sandtable](https://www.sandtable.com)), focusing on Agent Based Modelling (ABM) simulations.

Prior to this role, I was a senior data scientist at [CountingLab](https://www.countinglabs.co.uk/) and visiting researcher at [Centre for Mathematics of Human Behaviour](https://www.reading.ac.uk/cmohb/) at the University of Reading, UK.

# The Physics Years
Before becoming a data scientist, I have devoted my life in physics and particular theoretical physics. I obtained my D.Phil. (PhD) in theoretical physics from University of Oxford in 2013, studying aspects of dimensional reduction in graph models of cause quantum gravity.

In 2009 I graduated with excellence from the Physics department of the University of Athens, while also spending a semester at the University of Bonn, Germany, via the Erasmus programme.

# Interests
I have passion for physics, data science, sciences, technology, Lego (afol), scuba diving, basketball and analytics.

Panathinaikos and Liverpool fan.
