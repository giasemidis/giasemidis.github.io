# Publications

Through the years I have been publishing my work on theoretical physics and data science in high impact peer-reviewed journals, international conference proceedings and in book chapters.

Pre-print versions can be found on [arxv.org](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Giasemidis%2C+G), while more details on journals and citations can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=vVyWiE8AAAAJ).
